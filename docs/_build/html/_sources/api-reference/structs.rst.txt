``typedef struct bmp180_t``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Struct that holds temperature, pressure, altitude and sea pressure values. This struct also holds callibration data but it is highly discouraged  to access them. Also modifying them will probably result unexpected behaviour.

Members of struct:
""""""""""""""""""

Sensor data:

* ``float temperature``
* ``float pressure``
* ``float altitude``
* ``uint32_t sea_pressure``

Settings:

* ``int8_t   oss``
